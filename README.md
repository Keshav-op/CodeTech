"Overview"

The Student Management System is a console-based application designed to help users manage student information efficiently. It allows for the addition, editing, deletion, and display of student records, providing a straightforward way to track student data like IDs, names, grades, and averages. This system can be particularly beneficial in educational environments for teachers, administrators, and students.

Key Activities

1. Adding a Student:
   - Input: The user is prompted to enter the student's ID, name, and three grades.
   - Processing: The average of the grades is calculated.
   - Storage: The new student record is stored in the system's data structure.

2. Editing a Student:
   - Search: The user inputs the student ID to locate the record.
   - Update: Once found, the user can modify the student's name and grades.
   - Recalculation: The average grade is recalculated based on the updated grades.

3. Deleting a Student:
   - Search: The user inputs the student ID to identify the record to delete.
   - Removal: If found, the record is removed, and subsequent records are shifted to fill the gap.

4. Displaying All Students:
   - Output: The system lists all student records, showing ID, name, grades, and average.
   - Feedback: If there are no students, the system notifies the user.

5. User Interface (Menu System):
   - Navigation: A simple text-based menu allows users to select which action to perform.
   - Loop: The menu continues to prompt the user until they choose to exit, making the system user-friendly and persistent.

Summary:-

The Student Management System is designed to simplify the management of student records through its core functionalities of adding, editing, deleting, and displaying student information. By providing a structured and intuitive interface, it ensures that users can efficiently handle student data, making it a practical tool for educational settings.



Overview:-

The "Temperature Converter" program is a console-based application that allows users to convert temperatures between three scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting temperatures and selecting conversion options, ensuring a straightforward experience for users looking to perform temperature conversions.

Key Activities:-

1. User Input for Temperature Scale:
   - The program prompts the user to select the input temperature scale from the available options: Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
   - The user enters their choice, which determines how the subsequent temperature will be interpreted.

2. Temperature Entry:
   - After selecting the input scale, the user is prompted to enter the temperature value they wish to convert.

3. Conversion Selection:
   - Based on the chosen input scale, the program asks the user to select the desired output scale (i.e., what scale they want to convert the input temperature to).

4. Temperature Conversion:
   - The program calls the appropriate function for the selected conversion:
     - Celsius to Fahrenheit or Kelvin
     - Fahrenheit to Celsius or Kelvin
     - Kelvin to Celsius or Fahrenheit
   - Each function performs the necessary calculations and displays the converted temperature in a formatted output.

5. Error Handling:
   - The program checks for invalid selections at each stage (input scale, output scale) and informs the user if an invalid choice is made.

6. Program Termination:
   - After completing a conversion, the user can be prompted (if extended) to perform additional conversions or exit the program.

Conclusion:-

The temperature converter program effectively enables users to convert temperatures across different scales through a clear and interactive interface. By following a structured approach to user input, conversion logic, and error handling, it serves as a practical tool for anyone needing quick temperature conversions. With some enhancements, such as allowing multiple conversions in one run, the usability could be further improved.
